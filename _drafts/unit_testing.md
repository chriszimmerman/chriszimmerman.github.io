# TDD, A Form of Deliberation In Programming

Deliberation
    -the act of thinking about or discussing something and deciding carefully

Writing a failing test first makes you think about the inputs and the outputs of a test. This makes you empathetic toward the caller of the method you're testing. You most likely don't want to have to go through the work of a complicated setup in order to test the method you want to write, so you'll make the interface simple. As a by-product, anyone else who consumes this interface will have an easier time interacting with it as well.

Writing tests and predicting what will happen is a great exercise in measuring your understanding of the code.
