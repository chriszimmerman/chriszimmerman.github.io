*Note: This is the first of a number of personal essays I’m writing about my life that I would like to put into a book.*

I think that, as part of every high schooler’s curriculum, they should have to take up a part-time job at a fast food joint for at least three months. The experience teaches a few lessons. First of all, kids learn the value of earning pay. They understand the work that goes into getting the money and will appreciate it more.

In turn, they learn a second lesson. When they use their hard-earned money, they see the value in buying something with money they had to earn, as opposed to just having it given to them. They appreciate it more. 

The third lesson they’ll learn is how awfully boring and shitty working at a fast food joint is. This will encourage them to go to college or do something more exciting with their lives.

The forth lesson, and the most important one, is that they’ll see the value in being kind to one another.

Before my first job, my primary sources of income were birthday cards, good report card grades, and a weekly allowance from doing chores. The summer I turned fifteen, my dad told me that I should get a job. I can’t recall exactly why he told me to do that; I assume it had something to do with him wanting me to learn about work and responsibility. Since it was summer, it was also a good use of my time. I applied to a few fast food places and landed a job at a Wendy’s near the interstate. 

At the restaurant, a number of other high schoolers worked there, as well as college kids and full-grown adults.  There was JB, the head restaurant manager, who was middle aged. Other coworkers told me he could be a dick, but I never witnessed that during my short stay at the job. There were Laura and Matt, who were dating. Laura made sandwiches and Matt did dishes & took out trash. Vince was another manager there, also middle-aged, probably in his 40s. Vince was cool. He also gave me a piece of advice that has stayed with me to this day. I’ll talk about that later.

At first, I started off as a runner. That’s the person who assists the cashier in fetching drinks, sandwiches, and other food to place on a tray (or in a bag) for the customer. In such a position, I was proxy to customer interactions.

Most interactions were uneventful, but some could be unpleasant. Petty claims from customers that orders were messed up in an attempt to get a free meal. Being accused of being racist by a black dude because most of the employees were white and we got his order wrong. Customers looking down on you because you worked at a fast food joint and they didn’t. I probably got a pass because I was a kid, but people love to look down on adults working in food service. Working in a fast food joint is social stigma. It’s not the most glorious job, making french fries and cleaning bathrooms frequented by animals, but can’t we be fucking kinder to one another?

The money was nice. My sci-fi/fantasy book and video game addictions were sufficiently sated. I took care of anything I bought with my hard-earned cash, not that I didn’t before.

About a month or so in, I was promoted to drive-thru cashier. I was responsible for keeping an even balance on my register. My interactions with customers were brief: they handed me money, I handed them change. I told them to have a nice day. Right up my alley.

But of course they couldn’t pay me to just hang out by the window. When there weren’t customers, I had other responsibilities. I had to wash dishes, clean the bathrooms, put fries in the fryer, prepare chicken nuggets, refill the Frosty machine with brown goop, fetch burgers from the freezer, refill the chili bucket, and more. It sounds gross mixing sanitary duties with food prep duties but don’t worry, I washed my hands.

Eventually, the summer was over and I didn’t feel like handling both school AND a job at the same time, so I quit.

Even though I never want to work in a fast food joint again, I’m grateful for the experience. It helped develop my work ethic. I arrived at work on time. I put in my hours. I can tough out doing things that I don’t want to do. I value my money and I’m good with it. I’m definitely a better person for the experience.

I’d like to go back to the piece of wisdom that Vince bequeathed to me. There was an older lady, Tracy, who worked as a cashier. She wasn’t the best at her job and she wasn’t really personable. One day, I was helping Vince out with something while the topic of her came up. One piece of what he said really stuck out. This is the gist of what he said:

“Some people work in places like this all their lives. This is all they do. If you can go to school and do something better with your life, do it. You don’t want to be here forever.”

At that point in my life, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do for a career or where I wanted to go to school, but I knew I didn’t want to work in a fucking fast food restaurant again. I didn’t know any better at the time because I was a kid living at home with my parents, but the pay is unlivable for a grown adult, both 15 years ago and now. Minimum wage is great for paying kids that don’t know any better though. Plus, there will always be high-schoolers looking for a part-time job.

Most importantly, the job was completely intellectually unfulfilling. One thing I love about programming is that I’m never bored. I might get stressed out and exhausted, but I’m never bored. Sweeping floors, washing dishes, and ringing up Baconators only does so much for the mind. 

In summary:

1) People being shitty to me made me have more empathy and be kinder toward others.

2) Earning money made me appreciate it (and the stuff I bought with it) more.

3) Working at a fast food joint can be a drudge. Experiencing this firsthand can be a real eye-opener. There are more meaningful and interesting things to do with your life.
